# hello-world
This is a short description!

Hello, team.
New to github, real excited to be here. Would like to take a moment to thank the people who have helped me reach this point. Namely, the authors of the FAQ section, my good pal Google, and whoever wrote the story about Kaldi - a 9th century Ethiopean goatherder who 'discovered' coffee - I'm not sure the story is true, but I appreciate the telling, and it helped me round out my list of people to thank to 3, which is nice.
